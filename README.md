# gpt-cli-go

---

## Overview

This project is a rewrite of the GPT-CLI Python repository. It aims to allow better configuration with [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and provide more features than the previous project (like automatic per-language syntax highlighting with [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma#identifying-the-language))

I'm doing this rewrite mainly to learn Go and get experience with its concurrency patterns, standard library and package ecosystem.
